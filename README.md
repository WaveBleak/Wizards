# Wizards plugin template
**A quick template for the Wizards server on superawesome**

## How to expand on this plugin
First open the project in Intellij IDEA

Second, add a new class under the `abilities` package

Now you need to name the class and make sure it extends the `Ability` class

Then just implement the methods and fill out all of the methods (Look at documentation in IAbility for guidance)

You can also look at the BoostAbility I created as a basic example
